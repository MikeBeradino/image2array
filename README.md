# image2array
Python script to take bitmap images and convert them into arrays for LED matrices.

Not really done but it works. Still adding some features and further documentation.


Leds should be wired like this:

1     16 --> end...
2     15
3     14
4     13
5     12  
6     11
7     10
8 --> 9
